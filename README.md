The Number Dance game ported from ZX to GW Basic

Recently saw a [toot on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@juanfr/111425474871853048) for a ZX Spectrum game called [El Baile de los Numeros](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/16224/ZX-Spectrum/El_Baile_de_los_Numeros), which apparently translates to [The Number Dance](https://libretranslate.com/?source=es&target=en&q=el+baile+de+los+numeros).

Looked like fun so I had an initial run at porting it to GW Basic and the basic gameplay is there.
